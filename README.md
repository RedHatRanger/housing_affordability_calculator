# Housing Income Calculator

**Description:**  
This script, **`housing_income_calculator.py`**, helps you determine the amount of gross monthly and annual income required to afford a given monthly housing expense under the commonly used "30% rule." The 30% rule suggests that total housing costs—such as rent or a mortgage payment—should not exceed 30% of your gross monthly income. Adhering to this guideline can help ensure you maintain a balanced budget and stay on track financially.

**How It Works:**  
1. **User Input:**  
   The script prompts you to enter your monthly housing cost (for example, your expected rent or mortgage payment).

2. **Calculation Using the 30% Rule:**  
   The script applies the following formula:

## Monthly Income = Housing Cost / 0.30

This calculation determines the gross monthly income required so that your housing cost remains at or below the 30% threshold.

3. **Annual Income Estimation:**  
After calculating the required gross monthly income, the script multiplies that amount by 12 to provide an estimated annual gross income. This gives you a clear target for your yearly earnings.

**Intended Use Cases:**
- **Mortgage and Loan Qualification:**  
Before applying for a home loan, determine the annual gross income needed to comfortably afford the monthly mortgage payment you have in mind.

- **Rental Budgeting:**  
If you’re apartment hunting and know the monthly rent, quickly find out the monthly and annual incomes you’ll need to stay within the 30% guideline.

- **Financial Planning:**  
Use this tool for long-term financial planning to understand how housing expenses fit into your overall budget and financial goals.

By using **`housing_income_calculator.py`**, you can make more informed decisions about housing expenses, helping you maintain financial health and balance.
